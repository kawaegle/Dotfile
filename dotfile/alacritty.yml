env:
  # TERM variable
  #
  # This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for

  # check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
  # available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.

  # of as modifying the line spacing, and `offset.x` as modifying the letter
  # spacing.
  #offset:
  #  x: 0

  # Glyph offset determines the locations of the glyphs within their cells with

#
# Window opacity as a floating point number from `0.0` to `1.0`.
# The value `0.0` is completely transparent and `1.0` is opaque.

#mouse:
  # Click settings
  #
  # The `double_click` and `triple_click` settings control the time
